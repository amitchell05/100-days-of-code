# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I coded for at least 4 hours today for the CoderGirl Front End course. I completed my first assignment. I am waiting for it to be graded by my TAs/Mentors.

**Thoughts**: I seemed simplify my code greatly this time. My first attempt on this assignment months ago looks harder to read. I'm getting more comfortable with loops and template literals

### Day 2: August 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I studied coding for an hour today. I completed the first two sections of Colt Steele's The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp. Also, I helped out fellow classmates by reviewing their code for our exercises in CoderGirl's course.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying the class format of Colt Steele's courses on Udemy. It helps to see things broken down into smaller parts.

### Day 3: August 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed today's exercises and studios in the CoderGirl class.

**Thoughts**: I still feel awkward walking through my code with others and get embarrassed by my mistakes. As one of our instructors said, we're all still learning.

### Day 4: August 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed half of section 3 in Colt Steele's Modern JavaScript course on Udemy and worked through the conditionals module with SoloLearn.

**Thoughts**: I'm gradually understanding smaller concepts in JavaScript, but still worry if I will be able to apply my understanding to real projects.

### Day 5: August 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed JavaScript concept through freecodecamp's Basic JavaScript module. Also, for CoderGirl, we worked in groups to complete the studio assignment.

**Thoughts**: I felt a little better talking through the code this time. We watched a cute raccoon video when we finished it. Good times!

### Day 6: August 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through some tough coding challenges on JavaScript functions for CoderGirl.

**Thoughts**: Some days, there are some parts of my code I don't understand (esp. when it gets mathematical). I am glad I solved them so far, though.

### Day 7: August 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I read Chapter 11 of my web development book for CoderGirl. It covered recursion and anonymous functions. This is where things get tricky.

**Thoughts**: Mathematical reasoning is still somewhat confusing at times. I'm stuck on one part of my exercises, but so close to solving it.

### Day 8: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed Colt Steele's Intro to HTML and How to Model Data Efficiently sections today. Also, I solved the anonymous function exercise I had problems with yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I'm relieved, but I want to refactor my function to be recursive.

### Day 9: August 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed Section 4 of The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts**: I tend to practice coding for 2-5 hours a day since I'm in more than one class. I'm hoping I can find some balance so I can do my digital painting as well.

### Day 10: August 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I just completed "Calculator Project: HTML & CSS" by [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/calculator-html-css/. Today's CoderGirl WebDev lecture will cover functions.

**Thoughts**: I want to revisit these videos to grasp more concepts in HTML and CSS (especially flexbox), but it was a great experience! 

### Day 11: September 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Busy day coding yesterday. I helped a classmate with one of our class assignments.

**Thoughts**: It was great practice for explaining terminology and JavaScript concepts.

### Day 12: September 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed my third week in CoderGirl! We completed our exercises and studios about functions this week.

**Thoughts**: I'm gradually getting better with problem-solving, but I still feel I rely on the book a lot.

### Day 13: September 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the pre-work reading for next week's class on objects and the `Math` object. I also attended an inspiring webinar about time management from (Sidney Buckner)[@sidneybuckner18]. Thank you for the advice!

**Thoughts**: I feel I can greatly improve my study plan now.

### Day 14: September 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the main requirements for the second assignment for CoderGirl. I solved it months ago when working on the materials at my own pace. It looks different from my current one (in a bad way, somewhat).

**Thoughts**: Yet, I still want to check in with my mentors about my approach.

### Day 15: September 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I narrowed down my coding study session to one hour on Saturday. I completed half of Colt Steele's Intro to CSS course. 

**Thoughts**: It's encouraging to refamiliarize myself with CSS. I hope my studies will help me make user-friendly, inspiring websites soon.

### Day 16: September 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed Colt Steele's Intro to CSS section. Also, I completed the "bonus missions" for my second assignment in CoderGirl. 

**Thoughts**: It was great for identifying and using selectors. On to Intermediate CSS! I'm grateful for being able to stay slightly ahead of schedule in the CoderGirl course, but I also want to make sure I focus more on the journey and less on the destination.

### Day 17: September 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed half of Colt Steele's Bootstrap section on Udemy, coding along, and building responsive webpages. Also, I showed my father how my code for CoderGirl's Assignment 2 works.

**Thoughts**: It was nice to share my progress with my father, who likes technology.

### Day 18: September 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: We reviewed objects and the Math method in CoderGirl's class today. I'm completed most of the studios, but struggled with understanding the instructions.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I understand objects mostly, but I need to improve my problem-solving skills. Hopefully, tomorrow will be better.

### Day 19: September 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday, I had trouble understanding the JavaScript studio exercises in class. But, after a night of rest, I was able to debug, fix my code, and solve them! Also, I completed the reading and exercises about modules.

**Thoughts**: I'm relieved that I found my errors. Breaking things down into smaller pieces helped tremendously.

### Day 20: September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I focused on learning about unit testing. I'll have study this concept for a few more days to get more comfortable with test-driven development.

**Thoughts**: It's challenging to change my workflow, but it does seem to help with debugging better.

### Day 21: September 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the reading and exercises about unit testing in my CoderGirl course. Also, I finished the 1st part of Bootstrap in Web Dev Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I solved them. I want to refactor my code for one of the exercises to make it prettier.

### Day 22: September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about Bootstrap 4 from Colt Steele's videos. Also, I received positive feedback from my mentor about my code.

**Thoughts**: It's great to hear because I deal with impostor syndrome. I'm worried how busy this week will be, but I still look forward to studying more.

### Day 23: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A busy day! We reviewed modules in CoderGirl's class. I completed a portrait sketch for the One Week Portrait challenge from Paintable. I also attended my first tech conference, the CityofJS Conference 2020.

**Thoughts**: A great Day 1 experience learning JS topics and meeting new people! I am also grateful I could help fellow classmates with my solution approaches.

### Day 24: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday, I could only code for 30 minutes of coding. I started looking into my assigned reading about scope.

**Thoughts**: I'm gradually learning how the order of code execution works. Also, I have a better understanding of local and global scopes.

### Day 25: September 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: On Thursday, I finished my third assignment in CoderGirl that involved creating unit tests.

**Thoughts**: I'm still not comfortable with them, but I am glad my tests are passing so far. I will meet with my mentor to go over it before I submit it.

### Day 26: September 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Unknown (but I was DEFINITELY coding that day). The record for this day is missing.

**Thoughts**: I'm so upset that I messed my log up :-(

### Day 27: September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I am ahead of schedule with my prep work for CoderGirl. For the weekend, I will do some light studying and review the materials. 

**Thoughts**: Also, I will need some more rest and relaxation to prep for another busy week.

### Day 28: September 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Whew! I completed 70% of the Basic JavaScript module on freeCodeCamp, half of Bootstrap 4: Flexbox and Layout in the Web Developer Bootcamp, and tried some challenges from Frontend Mentor and Exercism.

**Thoughts**: I need to pace myself better. I got overwhelmed when I viewed the README for the Hundle Landing page. I've learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but this beginner project makes me nervous.

### Day 29: September 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Bootstrap 4 section in Colt Steele's class, but I feel like I will need to revisit it later. I also tried a few Exercism exercises for JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: Hopefully, I will get better with my problem-solving skills.

### Day 30: September 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, we covered unit testing in CoderGirl's class. I refactored my Assignment 3 and other exercises to not utilize deepStrictEqual at this time.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I know another way to solve the problem!

### Day 31: September 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: After days of refactoring one of my solutions for an exercise, I reached out for help from mentors in CoderGirl. A solution route finally clicked.

**Thoughts**: I'm grateful to my mentors for helping me with this problem. It was good refactoring practice, but also overwhelming!

### Day 32: September 23, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Practiced coding and attended the Black is Tech conference.

**Thoughts**: I did coding this day, but I think this might have been the missing entry. This will be a placeholder to keep the record on track

### Day 33: September 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished CoderGirl's Class 14's reading and exercise ahead of schedule. The Document Object Model (DOM) and events are the main topics covered in the section. Today was also the third day of Black isTech conference. I attended sessions that covered how to leverage your LinkedIn page and how to be a brand in tech (not just an employee).

**Thoughts**: I'm looking forward to learning more about how to use them! It was hard to absorb all the information at the event, but the resources recommended and connections.

### Day 34: September 25,2020

**Today's Progress**: I got a bit of a late start to my coding studies today. For CoderGirl, I read through half of a chapter covering HTTP. This chapter didn't involve repl.it exercises. So, I decided to try Exercism's resistor code duo exercise.

**Thoughts**: I solved the problem, but I'm wondering if my approach was correct. I'm waiting for feedback from a mentor to confirm I took the best path.

### Day 35: September 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: My third CoderGirl assignment has been graded! I'm halfway through Unit 1 of the front-end development track. I also completed reading about HTTP, user inputs, and forms. Soon, we'll be covering HTML and CSS (my favs!).

**Thoughts**: This will be another busy week...Conferences, classes, appointments, studying, and more. I must prepare myself.

### Day 36: September 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm almost halfway through Coursera's Intro to Figma guided project. I hope to learn more about front-end development and web design and utilize Figma for future projects. Also, I solve a few HackerRank exercises in the Problem-Solving section.

**Thoughts**: On some of them, I still feel I use Google too much to remind me of methods I can use. Hopefully, I will be able to recall them better with practice.

### Day 37: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: We covered classes in CoderGirl today. I have a better understanding of super() now. I also completed Coursera's Intro to Figma guided project and a few exercises on Hackerank and CodeHS.

**Thoughts**: I hope I will get better with remembering methods.

### Day 38: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A bit of a shorter day for coding. I backed up my repl.it files (Classroom is nearing end-of-life). I worked on exercises from Exercism, CodeHS, and HackerRank.

**Thoughts**: I'm close to solving the Time Conversion on HackerRank. Missing the first 0...hmm

### Day 39: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm still having trouble with the HackerRank Time Conversion problem and Exercism Gigasecond problem. But, CoderGirl provided a bit of a break from math and covered one of my favorite things: HTML!

**Thoughts**: I made fun changes to People.com's website during studio time tonight. Anything with a Corgi brightens my day!

### Day 40: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the fetch and JSON reading and exercises for CoderGirl. Also, I worked through more JavaScript exercises from freeCodeCamp (~80% completed!). 

**Thoughts**: This has been a weird day of self-reflection on my future. I need a detailed career development plan.

### Day 41: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: After getting help from one of my CoderGirl instructors and a fellow classmate with the initializing my project, I finished my TypeScript exercise! I'm truly grateful for the support I have in CoderGirl. I'll be checking out The Net Ninja tutorials for more practice. It's been a rough week on in various ways, especially for my sleep schedule. I could only attend two virtual presentations at the nodejsday conference because it was an international one (it started at 2 am in my time zone).

**Thoughts**: This weekend's plan: light coding, digital painting, self-care, errands, and SLEEP!!! Will it work out? I'm not sure, but I will try my best.

### Day 42: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Short coding day. I completed a few exercises on Coderbyte. I also viewed the first video of The Net Ninja's HTML and CSS Crash Course. Most of my day was focused on applying for an internship position and a full-time position.

**Thoughts**: It is the first time I've applied for a tech job since 2018, which was my first tech job application after graduating from LaunchCode's LC101 program. I'm nervous for various reasons. After receiving encouragement from mentors and classmates, I decided to leap. Geez, this year has involved me taking a TON of leaps. I've done so in the past in some ways, but not this frequently.

### Day 43: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished a few challenges on HackerRank. My critical thinking and problem-solving skills seem to be improving.

**Thoughts**: Even though I used Google searches for understanding the math concepts of the exercises, my approach seemed to be less off than I feel they are.

### Day 44: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I was asked to be a student floater TA again for CoderGirl's catch up day. I got back to working through Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I'm grateful to have the opportunity to help others and learn new ways to approach problems. I hope I can improve my ability to explain coding concepts in more diverse ways. For Colt Steele's course, there will be a revision to the program coming this week! I still don't know if I should wait or continue. I've completed ~25% of the course so far.

### Day 45: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: In the evening, I did a little more floater TA work in CoderGirl. I did my best to help, but I couldn't figure out how to fix the errors we came across. Yet, once again, the power of SLEEP saved the day!

**Thoughts**: I woke up this morning and figured out a few references that were missing. I left comments in a copy of my classmate's code to detail the approach I took to refactoring a few of the lines and offered to talk through it with them. Hoping that I'm able to help!

### Day 46: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: We had a great CoderGirl class today covering CSS and more Git topics. I also had fun working in a group on our communication log exercise. It brightened my day being able to learn with and help my classmates use Git.

**Thoughts**: I'm still getting used to Git, but I am a little more comfortable with it now than I was. I encountered it in 2018 through LaunchCode's LC101 program. I'm grateful for LaunchCode's courses, helping me get closer into tech one step at a time.

### Day 47: October 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: This morning, I completed my one-way video interview for a tech position. I was very nervous, but this year, I've been taking leaps of faith. So, I did my best to be authentic as I answered the questions. I pray I'm taking the right steps forward.

**Thoughts**: Also, I was able to help another fellow classmate understand parts of Assignment 3 for CoderGirl. It always lifts my spirits up when I can serve a purpose and help others.

### Day 48: October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I had an awesome conversation with a classmate about coding, career development, and life today. It helps to learn, brainstorm, and talk about hopes with others, especially during these times. I'm taking things one step at a time and trying to be positive. I hope I can channel that mentally as I work on completing Assignment 4 for CoderGirl on time.

**Thoughts**: I'm making a resume website for the assignment, but impostor syndrome and perfectionism trying to get the best of me. I care about this project a lot! I want to build projects I'm passionate about and showcase them on my website. Art, music, writing, video games, physical and mental well-being...it's all overwhelming. I hope I can choose at least one to focus on.

### Day 49: October 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Almost 50 days of coding and a month left before the end of Unit 1 in CoderGirl. Time has flown by so fast! Today, I spoke with one of my mentors during his office hours about my progress on Assignment 4. He says I'm on the right track with my HTML setup.

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow, it will be time to style it and bring a design to life for my resume website. I'm nervous, but this project is another important step that can help me become a front-end web developer.

### Day 50: October 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Halfway done with the 100-day challenge, but it will not be the end of my coding journey. I've added some styling to my resume website for CoderGirl's Assignment 4!

**Thoughts**: I ended up working on coding at night until 1 a.m. again. Beside my wonky sleep schedule, I enjoyed working on a project that is more based on front-end development. Becoming a front-end web developer is my goal, but I still worry if I will be creative enough. It's inspired by a free design I found online, only applying snippets I like. Hopefully, with time, I'll be able to feel more artistic with web design, like I feel I am with art. #CodeNewbie

### Day 51: October 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 51! Today, I finished Assignments 4 AND 5 for CoderGirl today ahead of schedule, ready to be graded! I love how my resume website is coming together. I hope I can build more projects, gain more experience, and share my progress on my website.

**Thoughts**: I want to keep fixing and improving my website. For now, I've been told I accomplished all of the required parts of the assignment for class.

### Day 52: October 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've been feeling a bit drained mentally from the job search, but I was able to finish CoderGirl's Angular Part 3 reading. The last chapter of the JavaScript book is fairly short. So, I will be done with all of the reading assignments for Unit 1 tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Time has truly flown by! It's exciting, but also overwhelming. I am determined to become a front-end developer to find a 'joy-money-flow' balance. Joy and flow (work that you are good at) matter the most to me. This is important for me to feel my work is meaningful and authentic.

### Day 53: October 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed all of the reading assignments in CoderGirl's Unit 1 JavaScript course. I will try my best to review what I have learned by attending different webinars, doing coding exercises, and seeking help with complex coding problems and concepts.

**Thoughts**: Aspects of Angular make sense, but I need more practice to get comfortable with event listeners and data-binding. I will try to practice more this week while doing some self-care after a draining week.

### Day 54: October 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: On Wednesday, I almost completed a CoderGirl studio covering the DOM and events. I ended up getting stumped on the last part. After getting some rest, I was able to solve the final task and bonus section this morning. Rest is a powerful thing...

**Thoughts**: I wish it helped me with decision-making more, though. I want to officially switch my job search focus to tech-related jobs (esp. entry-level/junior front-end developer roles). I've been looking for data entry roles because it's the only work experience I have. But, I do not want to stay on that path for a variety of reasons (a very long story...). Yet, I'm afraid of not being able to find my way into tech because of my lack of work experience. I also have a degree in liberal studies, specializing in art and music. Some blogs say that a liberal studies degree is valuable...and some say they are not. I'm hoping my background, values, and skills can be seen as assets to an organization/company, helping them fulfill meaningful goals.

### Day 55: October 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I got so caught up in working on my first (technically) Frontend Mentor challenge, I ended up working on some of the initial HTML and CSS until 1 AM. Persevering face It's been fun to apply what I've learned from CoderGirl, The Web Developer Bootcamp, and other classes.

**Thoughts**: I don't have much established yet. I am stuck on some things, but feel free to check it out.  I appreciate any feedback to help me become a front-end developer.

### Day 56: October 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: This weekend has given me time to work on solidifying my knowledge of the DOM and events. Carrie, one of CoderGirl's TA, held a Zoom meeting for students who want to practice concepts related to Assignment 5.

**Thoughts**: I completed my assignment Monday. My solution passed today, but I still want to practice more. I also added JavaScript and more styling to my Frontend Mentor challenge project. I'm excited I was able to implement a toggle feature for the headings! If I can figure out how to correctly position the images, reduce the length of dividers, and center the container, I may finish my first Frontend Mentor challenge!

### Day 57: October 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A short, late coding day. I finished a "non-responsive" version of the FAQ accordion page for Frontend Mentor's challenge.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to learn more about responsive web design soon.

### Day 58: October 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, we covered HTTP, user inputs, and forms in CoderGirl. I also had a great conversation with our new Success Coach and received helpful job prep advice and encouragement. In class, I still struggle with impostor syndrome.

**Thoughts**: I continue to be self-critical of myself and my solutions/approaches to coding problems. In one way, it keeps me grounded and more open-minded. In another way, it hurts my self-esteem. I hope I find a healthy medium.

### Day 59: October 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today wasn't a great coding day. I thought I made progress on my faq-accordion-card-main project, but now I'm totally stuck. This is a hard Frontend Mentor challenge for me as a #CodeNewbie. I tried to use a border to see what's going on with my columns.

**Thoughts**: No success, though with the [FAQ Accordion Project](https://github.com/amitchell05/faq-accordion-card-main). If I can't figure it out now, I will probably have to put this project on hold and work on a different challenge.
