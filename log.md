# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I coded for at least 4 hours today for the CoderGirl Front End course. I completed my first assignment. I am waiting for it to be graded by my TAs/Mentors.

**Thoughts:** I seemed simplify my code greatly this time. My first attempt on this assignment months ago looks harder to read. I'm getting more comfortable with loops and template literals

### Day 2: August 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I studied coding for an hour today. I completed the first two sections of Colt Steele's The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp. Also, I helped out fellow classmates by reviewing their code for our exercises in CoderGirl's course.

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying the class format of Colt Steele's courses on Udemy. It helps to see things broken down into smaller parts.

### Day 3: August 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed today's exercises and studios in the CoderGirl class.

**Thoughts:** I still feel awkward walking through my code with others and get embarrassed by my mistakes. As one of our instructors said, we're all still learning.

### Day 4: August 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed half of section 3 in Colt Steele's Modern JavaScript course on Udemy and worked through the conditionals module with SoloLearn.

**Thoughts:** I'm gradually understanding smaller concepts in JavaScript, but still worry if I will be able to apply my understanding to real projects.

### Day 5: August 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed JavaScript concept through freecodecamp's Basic JavaScript module. Also, for CoderGirl, we worked in groups to complete the studio assignment.

**Thoughts:** I felt a little better talking through the code this time. We watched a cute raccoon video when we finished it. Good times!

### Day 6: August 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through some tough coding challenges on JavaScript functions for CoderGirl.

**Thoughts:** Some days, there are some parts of my code I don't understand (esp. when it gets mathematical). I am glad I solved them so far, though.

## Saved Example

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
