# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I coded for at least 4 hours today for the CoderGirl Front End course. I completed my first assignment. I am waiting for it to be graded by my TAs/Mentors.

**Thoughts**: I seemed simplify my code greatly this time. My first attempt on this assignment months ago looks harder to read. I'm getting more comfortable with loops and template literals

### Day 2: August 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I studied coding for an hour today. I completed the first two sections of Colt Steele's The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp. Also, I helped out fellow classmates by reviewing their code for our exercises in CoderGirl's course.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying the class format of Colt Steele's courses on Udemy. It helps to see things broken down into smaller parts.

### Day 3: August 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed today's exercises and studios in the CoderGirl class.

**Thoughts**: I still feel awkward walking through my code with others and get embarrassed by my mistakes. As one of our instructors said, we're all still learning.

### Day 4: August 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed half of section 3 in Colt Steele's Modern JavaScript course on Udemy and worked through the conditionals module with SoloLearn.

**Thoughts**: I'm gradually understanding smaller concepts in JavaScript, but still worry if I will be able to apply my understanding to real projects.

### Day 5: August 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed JavaScript concept through freecodecamp's Basic JavaScript module. Also, for CoderGirl, we worked in groups to complete the studio assignment.

**Thoughts**: I felt a little better talking through the code this time. We watched a cute raccoon video when we finished it. Good times!

### Day 6: August 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through some tough coding challenges on JavaScript functions for CoderGirl.

**Thoughts**: Some days, there are some parts of my code I don't understand (esp. when it gets mathematical). I am glad I solved them so far, though.

### Day 7: August 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I read Chapter 11 of my web development book for CoderGirl. It covered recursion and anonymous functions. This is where things get tricky.

**Thoughts**: Mathematical reasoning is still somewhat confusing at times. I'm stuck on one part of my exercises, but so close to solving it.

### Day 8: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed Colt Steele's Intro to HTML and How to Model Data Efficiently sections today. Also, I solved the anonymous function exercise I had problems with yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I'm relieved, but I want to refactor my function to be recursive.

### Day 9: August 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed Section 4 of The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts**: I tend to practice coding for 2-5 hours a day since I'm in more than one class. I'm hoping I can find some balance so I can do my digital painting as well.

### Day 10: August 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I just completed "Calculator Project: HTML & CSS" by [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/calculator-html-css/. Today's CoderGirl WebDev lecture will cover functions.

### Day 12: September 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed my third week in CoderGirl! We completed our exercises and studios about functions this week.

**Thoughts**: I'm gradually getting better with problem-solving, but I still feel I rely on the book a lot.

### Day 13: September 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the pre-work reading for next week's class on objects and the `Math` object. I also attended an inspiring webinar about time management from (Sidney Buckner)[@sidneybuckner18]. Thank you for the advice!

**Thoughts**: I feel I can greatly improve my study plan now.

### Day 14: September 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the main requirements for the second assignment for CoderGirl. I solved it months ago when working on the materials at my own pace. It looks different from my current one (in a bad way, somewhat).

**Thoughts**: Yet, I still want to check in with my mentors about my approach.

### Day 15: September 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I narrowed down my coding study session to one hour on Saturday. I completed half of Colt Steele's Intro to CSS course.

### Day 16: September 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed Colt Steele's Intro to CSS section. Also, I completed the "bonus missions" for my second assignment in CoderGirl. 

**Thoughts**: It was great for identifying and using selectors. On to Intermediate CSS! I'm grateful for being able to stay slightly ahead of schedule in the CoderGirl course, but I also want to make sure I focus more on the journey and less on the destination.

### Day 17: September 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed Colt Steele's Intermediate CSS section. The rest of the week will be mainly dedicated to my CoderGirl studies.

**Thoughts**: I like styling websites, except when it comes to measuring things (box model etc.).

### Day 18: September 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed half of Colt Steele's Bootstrap section on Udemy, coding along, and building responsive webpages. Also, I showed my father how my code for CoderGirl's Assignment 2 works.

**Thoughts**: It was nice to share my progress with my father, who likes technology.

### Day 19: September 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: We reviewed objects and the Math method in CoderGirl's class today. I'm completed most of the studios, but struggled with understanding the instructions.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I understand objects mostly, but I need to improve my problem-solving skills. Hopefully, tomorrow will be better.

### Day 20: September 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday, I had trouble understanding the JavaScript studio exercises in class. But, after a night of rest, I was able to debug, fix my code, and solve them! Also, I completed the reading and exercises about modules.

**Thoughts**: I'm relieved that I found my errors. Breaking things down into smaller pieces helped tremendously.

### Day 21: September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I focused on learning about unit testing. I'll have study this concept for a few more days to get more comfortable with test-driven development.

**Thoughts**: It's challenging to change my workflow, but it does seem to help with debugging better.

### Day 22: September 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the reading and exercises about unit testing in my CoderGirl course. Also, I finished the 1st part of Bootstrap in Web Dev Bootcamp.

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about Bootstrap 4 from Colt Steele's videos. Also, I received positive feedback from my mentor about my code.

**Thoughts**: It's great to hear because I deal with impostor syndrome. I'm worried how busy this week will be, but I still look forward to studying more.

### Day 24: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A busy day! We reviewed modules in CoderGirl's class. I completed a portrait sketch for the One Week Portrait challenge from Paintable. I also attended my first tech conference, the CityofJS Conference 2020.

**Thoughts**: A great Day 1 experience learning JS topics and meeting new people! I am also grateful I could help fellow classmates with my solution approaches.

### Day 25: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday, I could only code for 30 minutes of coding. I started looking into my assigned reading about scope.

**Thoughts**: I'm gradually learning how the order of code execution works. Also, I have a better understanding of local and global scopes.

### Day 26: September 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: On Thursday, I finished my third assignment in CoderGirl that involved creating unit tests.

**Thoughts**: I'm still not comfortable with them, but I am glad my tests are passing so far. I will meet with my mentor to go over it before I submit it.

### Day 27: September 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I am ahead of schedule with my prep work for CoderGirl. For the weekend, I will do some light studying and review the materials. 

**Thoughts**: Also, I will need some more rest and relaxation to prep for another busy week.

### Day 28: September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Whew! I completed 70% of the Basic JavaScript module on freeCodeCamp, half of Bootstrap 4: Flexbox and Layout in the Web Developer Bootcamp, and tried some challenges from Frontend Mentor and Exercism.

**Thoughts**: I need to pace myself better. I got overwhelmed when I viewed the README for the Hundle Landing page. I've learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but this beginner project makes me nervous.

### Day 29: September 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Bootstrap 4 section in Colt Steele's class, but I feel like I will need to revisit it later. I also tried a few Exercism exercises for JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: Hopefully, I will get better with my problem-solving skills.

### Day 30: September 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, we covered unit testing in CoderGirl's class. I refactored my Assignment 3 and other exercises to not utilize deepStrictEqual at this time.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I know another way to solve the problem!

### Day 31: September 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: fter days of refactoring one of my solutions for an exercise, I reached out for help from mentors in CoderGirl. A solution route finally clicked.

**Thoughts**: I'm grateful to my for helping me with this problem. It was good refactoring practice, but also overwhelming! 

## Saved Example

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
